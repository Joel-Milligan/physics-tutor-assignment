# Purpose

1. Instructional Web application teaching student classical physics, with formative assessments
2. Unit for CITS3403 unit at University of Western Australia 2021

# Design


## First Design

We drew up our wire frame using a free web application called [Figma](https://www.figma.com).

Screen shots of these are stored in the wireframes directory in the root of this repository.

These were for very basic structure of the site, and as such most of the content in the wireframes are placeholder, namely colour choices and text.

# Development

## Git Flow

For source control management, we used a stripped down version of the "Git Flow" methodology, as described in this [web page](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-flow).
We used this as it is an industry standard and scales well to large teams and applications.

# Agile


## Project Management

To manage project development, we will be using GitHub's Projects feature.

This manages user stories, and issues in a Kanban style with To Do, In Progress, and Done columns, similar to Jira or Azure DevOps.

We have created 2 projects, one for front end development and one for backend development, for seperation of concerns.

Automation has been setup on these projects to automatically move cards between columns on certain events such as pull requests, merges, or issue creation.
