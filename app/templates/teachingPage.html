  <h2>What is Physics</h2>
  <p>
    As stated in the encyclopedia Britannica: Physics is the science that deals
    with the structure of matter and the interactions between the fundamental
    constituents of the observable universe. In the broadest sense, physics
    (from the Greek physikos) is concerned with all aspects of nature on both
    the macroscopic and submicroscopic levels. Its scope of study encompasses
    not only the behaviour of objects under the action of given forces but also
    the nature and origin of gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear force
    fields. Its ultimate objective is the formulation of a few comprehensive
    principles that bring together and explain all such disparate phenomena.

  <h2>What are we learning about today</h2>
  <p>
    This page is concerned with the basics of kinematics, which is the branch of
    physics that explains how objects move, and how quantities such as
    acceleration and velocity interact.

<div id="The 5 basic quantities" class="grey_box">
  <h2>The 5 basic quantities</h2>
  <p>
    In kinematics, there are 5 quantities that tell us everything we need to
    know about the moving object.
  </p>
  <p>They are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Displacement: How far the object has moved</li>
    <li>Initial Velocity: How fast the object was moving</li>
    <li>Final Velocity: How fast the object is or will be moving</li>
    <li>Acceleration: How fast the object changes velocity</li>
    <li>Time: How long the object was moving for</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These 5 quantities are often called the SUVAT quantites, as they are
    commonly represented by those letters
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Displacement: S</li>
    <li>Initial Velocity: U</li>
    <li>Final Velocity: V</li>
    <li>Acceleration: A</li>
    <li>Time: T</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How do these quantites relate?</h2>
  <p>
    Thanks to the work of some very
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion#:~:text=Galileo%20deduced%20the%20equation%20s,a%20projectile%20is%20a%20parabola."
      >clever people</a
    >, a set of 5 equations were developed. When any 3 of the SUVAT quantites
    are known, the other 2 can be derived by using the appropriate equations
